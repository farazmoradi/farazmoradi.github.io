WWelcome to my website! I am thrilled to share with you my ongoing exploration and research at the exciting intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. As a passionate enthusiast in both fields, I am constantly delving into the fascinating world of understanding the human brain and harnessing the power of cutting-edge technologies. Through my work, I aim to uncover the mysteries of the brain and develop innovative solutions that leverage machine learning algorithms to enhance our understanding of cognitive processes, brain disorders, and human behavior. Join me on this captivating journey as we explore the realms of neuroscience and machine learning, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in these captivating fields.

## Towards Real-World BCI: CCSPNet, A Compact Subject-Independent Motor Imagery Framework
A conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) requires a complete data gathering, training, and cal- ibration phase for each user before it can be used. In recent years, a number of subject-independent (SI) BCIs have been developed. Many of these methods yield a weaker performance compared to the subject-dependent (SD) approach, and some are computationally expensive. A potential real- world application would greatly benefit from a more accurate, compact, and computationally efficient subject-independent BCI. In this work, we propose a novel subject-independent BCI framework, named CCSPNet (Convolutional Common Spatial Pattern Network) that is trained on the motor imagery (MI) paradigm of a large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) signals database consisting of 400 trials for every 54 subjects who perform two-class hand-movement MI tasks. The proposed framework applies a wavelet kernel convolutional neural network (WKCNN) and a temporal convolutional neural net- work (TCNN) in order to represent and extract the spectral features of EEG signals. A common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is implemented for spatial feature extraction, and the number of CSP features is reduced by a dense neural network. Finally, the class label is determined by a linear dis- criminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The CCSPNet evaluation results show that it is possible to have a compact BCI that achieves both SD and SI state-of-the-art performance comparable to complex and computationally expensive models.

Afterward, a temporal convolutional neural network with normal one-dimensional convo- lutional kernels will be applied to the data (third column). These two networks are spectral feature extractors and do not reduce the number of channels. Then, a common spatial pattern algorithm will be applied to each CNN output to filter the data spatially and extract spatial features (fourth column), and a dense artificial neural network is used for CSP feature reduction (fifth column). Finally, an LDA classifier outputs the predicted class labels (sixth and seventh columns). ")


## Early Electrophysiological Aberrations in the Hippocampus of the TgF344-AD Rat Model as a Potential Biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease Prognosis

The hippocampus is thought to guide navigation and has an essential contribution to learning and memory. Hippocampus is one of the brain regions impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease with progressive memory impairments and cognitive decline. Although successful treatments for AD are still not available, developing new strategies to detect AD at early stages before clinical manifestation is crucial for timely interventions. Here, we investigated in the TgF344-AD rat model the classification of AD-transgenic rats versus Wild-type littermates (WT) from electrophysiological activity recorded in the hippocampus of freely moving subjects at an early, pre-symptomatic stage of the disease (6 months old). To this end, recorded signals were filtered in two separate frequency regimes namely low frequency LFP signals and high frequency spiking activity and passed to machine learning (ML) classifiers to identify the genotype of the rats (TG vs. WT). For the low frequency analysis, we first filtered the signals and extracted the power spectra in different frequency bands known to carry differential information in the hippocampus (delta, theta, slow- and fast-gamma) while for the high frequency analysis, we extracted spike-trains of neurons and calculated different distance metrics between them, including Van Rossum (VR), Inter Spike Interval (ISI), and Event Synchronization (ES). These measures were then used as features for classification with different ML classifiers. We found that both low and high frequency signals were able to classify the rat genotype with a high accuracy with specific signals such as the gamma band power, providing an important fraction of information. In addition, when we combined information from both low and high frequency the classification was boosted indicating that independent information is present across the two bands. The results of this study offer a better insight into how different regions of the hippocampus are affected in earlier stages of AD.

A head-stage was attached to the laminar silicon probe which was placed in the right dorsal hippocampus. The head-stage converts the analog signals recorded from the brain to digital signals, which were then send to the receiver hardware. The head-stage was powered by a small battery mounted on top of the head-stage to allow maximum freedom of movement. (B) Graphical representation of the track where the animals freely moved during the recordings. It consisted of a circular area in the middle with a diameter of 40 cm and two rectangular arms of 20x60 cm. At the end of each arm, rewards were periodically provided to motivate the animals to move back and forth. (C) The relative positions of Hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC) and dentate gyrus (DG) formation are illustrated. Fast and slow gamma oscillations reflect inputs from medial EC and CA3, respectively. (D) Graphs show representative data recorded in the hippocampus of one rat. The spike sorting algorithm runs on the high-frequency signal (band-pass filtered between 300 and 4900 Hz) of the raw data and uses common average reference (CAR) filter to remove mutual noise among channels. The low-frequency signal (band-pass filtered between 0.1 and 300 Hz) of the raw data was analyzed using time-frequency methods to extract desired frequency bands and then perform the classification task.

## A Protocol for Isolating Neural Activity of Neurons and Analyzing Their Behavior in a Pattern Separation Task (Master Thesis)


Understanding how the human brain works can lead to new discoveries and improved treatments for brain related diseases and disabilities such as Alzheimer's and autism. One method for studying brain activity is through electrophysiological recordings, particularly through the use of in vivo recording techniques. While these techniques have advanced significantly over the years, data analysis tools have not kept pace, making it difficult to isolate the activity of individual neurons from the recordings. In this thesis, we propose a protocol for isolating the spike activity of a neuron from an electrophysiology recording. We compared various toolboxes in different phases of the protocol and ensured that the input and output formats were standardized and user-friendly for neuroscientists having limited background in computer science and programming. Additionally, we conducted further investigation of the recorded cells (Mossy and Granule Cell) during a pattern separation task using classical spike train analysis methods. We also tracked the behavior of each isolated cell to gain insight into their role in the experiment.

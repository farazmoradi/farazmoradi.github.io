Welcome to my website! I am thrilled to share with you my ongoing exploration and research at the exciting intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. As a passionate enthusiast in both fields, I am constantly delving into the fascinating world of understanding the human brain and harnessing the power of cutting-edge technologies. Through my work, I aim to uncover the mysteries of the brain and develop innovative solutions that leverage machine learning algorithms to enhance our understanding of cognitive processes, brain disorders, and human behavior. Join me on this captivating journey as we explore the realms of neuroscience and machine learning, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in these captivating fields.

## Towards Real-World BCI: CCSPNet, A Compact Subject-Independent Motor Imagery Framework
A conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) requires a complete data gathering, training, and cal- ibration phase for each user before it can be used. In recent years, a number of subject-independent (SI) BCIs have been developed. Many of these methods yield a weaker performance compared to the subject-dependent (SD) approach, and some are computationally expensive. A potential real- world application would greatly benefit from a more accurate, compact, and computationally efficient subject-independent BCI. In this work, we propose a novel subject-independent BCI framework, named CCSPNet (Convolutional Common Spatial Pattern Network) that is trained on the motor imagery (MI) paradigm of a large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) signals database consisting of 400 trials for every 54 subjects who perform two-class hand-movement MI tasks. The proposed framework applies a wavelet kernel convolutional neural network (WKCNN) and a temporal convolutional neural net- work (TCNN) in order to represent and extract the spectral features of EEG signals. A common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is implemented for spatial feature extraction, and the number of CSP features is reduced by a dense neural network. Finally, the class label is determined by a linear dis- criminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The CCSPNet evaluation results show that it is possible to have a compact BCI that achieves both SD and SI state-of-the-art performance comparable to complex and computationally expensive models.
